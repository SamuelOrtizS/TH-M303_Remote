You need an Arduino running [AGirs](https://github.com/bengtmartensson/AGirs/), a Mega2560 board is highly recommended but it can be done using an Uno board if you only use the transmit module.

Right now it just contains the remote for the JVC TH-M303 DVD/HomeTheater kit, however the infrared codes and buttons are easy to edit in Android Studio to suit your needs.

Made in just one day, could be optimized so feel free to contribute.

A more complete app, inspired by many infrared remotes for phones with an ir blaster is in process, aimed to have more protocols for automation in a single app.

Its easy to use, fill the ip address and the port in the top fields, then just click connect.
